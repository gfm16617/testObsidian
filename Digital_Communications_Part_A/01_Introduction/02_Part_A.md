# Part A - Analog Communications

I am going to start with the analog signals of the communications, because of two reasons:

1. it is easier to understand the initial concepts of modulation in particular analog signals in a lab bench, which in turn helps understanding the math that supports it.
2. digital communications concepts build on top of analog concepts. Understanding the analog block diagrams, spectrum and the mathematical expressions of analog signals will equip you with the tools to then tackle the digital signals of wireless communications. 

I will be using the diagram below to cover the concepts of Part A of this course.

Print it, download it or design it in a piece of paper. If you ever feel lost come back to this main diagram to situate yourself.

> I know this diagram is very simple, but in Part B of this course, a similar diagram will get extensive quickly and increases the chances of the learner to get overwhelmed.
>  
> For now this diagram gives a good opportunity to get familiar with the concepts before things getting too complex.  

This diagram will also be used in a later section to help reverse engineering some radio examples that we use or encounter in our daily life.
