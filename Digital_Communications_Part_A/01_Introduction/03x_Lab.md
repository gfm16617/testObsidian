We are going to building a dipole antenna that it will work for a $f_c=300MHz$
We will use a function generator to transmit the waveform and an oscilloscope to visualize the received signal.

The length of the antenna is $L=\frac{c}{2f}=0.5\;(meters)$

Antenna length equation:
$$L=\frac{\lambda}{2}=\frac{c}{2f}$$
