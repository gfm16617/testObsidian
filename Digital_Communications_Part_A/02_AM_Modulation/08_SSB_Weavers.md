# SSB - Weaver's Method

![[types_weavers_map.png]]

The last method of generating SSB is called the Weaver's method. This method differs a little bit from the first two methods ...

The Weaver's method is very well suited for Software Define Radios, because digital mixers and their sine and cosine LO signals can be generated with extremely high phase and amplitude accuracy. The same holds for the two identical low-pass filters. Thus no gain and phase variations occur and the circuit is perfectly balanced for very high performance.
